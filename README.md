fake osu created with [sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/)

Sprig is a handheld console made by Hack Club running Jerryscript (Javascript engine) on a Pi Pico. They have built in commands to make tile-based games, and the console also doubles as a hardware development kit. It arrives disassembled, and you can use the parts for the console, or repurpose them for your own projects. It's powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico, so you can reflash the firmware with the touch of a button and run anything you want. The whole thing, including hardware, is open source, check them out [here](https://github.com/hackclub/sprig/)

## Apples are falling from the sky, and you must catch them! 
This game is played similar to games such as osu! mania, Friday Night Funkin', Piano Tiles, or Guitar Hero. You must hit the apples as they touch the receptors at the bottom of the playing field. There are 4 receptors, and they can be hit with the following keybinds from left to right: S, D, K, L. When you start the game, it will pick a rhythm and randomly generate repeating melodies that will align with your keystrokes.
